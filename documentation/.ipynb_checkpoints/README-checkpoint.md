# Final Project: Python for Data Analysis and Creative Application Development

## Overview

Develop a Python-powered project that integrates data analysis, external APIs, and OpenAI API(s) to address a meaningful business problem and create an innovative application. Showcase your findings and application design through a structured presentation and documentation.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Choose a Topic

* Pick a topic that resonates with your interests or curiosity.

### 2. Find or Collect Data

* Identify a dataset from a reliable source (e.g., Kaggle, data.gov, or API outputs in JSON/CSV)
* Ensure the data is relevant and provides a strong foundation for analysis and application development
    * Synthetic datasets are disallowed

### 3. Analyze Data and Derive Insights

* Clean, preprocess, and analyze the dataset using techniques covered in class.
* Visualize results with clear, effective charts and graphs.
* Address a specific business-relevant question, such as:
    * Identifying trends or patterns.
    * Making predictions or optimizing processes.

### 4. Develop a Creative Application

* Design and implement an application within a Jupyter Notebook that uses:
    * ``Dataset:`` Utilize your analyzed dataset to support application functions
        * ``AND/OR and External API:`` Integrate at least one API to add dynamic functionality (e.g., live data retrieval from OpenWeatherMap or PokéAPI)
        * ``OpenAI API(s):`` Incorporate OpenAI to generate text, images, or audio for added creativity and intelligence

### 5. Create two (2) to three (3) Features

Each feature should:
* Accept __input__ from the user (e.g., a query, a prompt, or specific parameters)
* Retrieve and process data from your dataset or external API(s)
* Generate an __output__ using OpenAI API(s), such as:
    * Natural language summaries or recommendations
    * Visual content (e.g., data visualizations, AI-generated images)
    * Audio output (e.g., synthesized insights or narratives)

## Deliverables

### 1. Presentation Slides

1. Overview (1 slide):
    *  Background and motivation
    *  Why is this topic important? Who benefits?
2. Data Description (1-2 slide):
    * Dataset source and collection process
    * Key variables, statistics (# rows and columns), and relevance to your project
4. Data Analysis (3–4 slides):
    * Summarize analysis results, including charts and insights
    * Highlight key findings that support your application
6. Application Design (1–2 slides):
    * ``Main components of the application:`` dataset, APIs, OpenAI
    * Architecture or workflow diagram to show integration
8. 2-3 Functions (4–6 slides):
    * Describe and illustrate each function, including:
        * Purpose and user interaction
        * Integration of dataset, external API, and OpenAI
        * Use case screenshots showing outputs
10. Summary (1–2 slides):
    * Recap the project’s goals, results, and value
    * Potential future enhancements
    * Key lessons learned during the project

### 2. HTML Document

* Rendered from your Jupyter Notebook, including:
    * Well-documented code
    * Markdown descriptions of your methodology and findings
    * Outputs from your application showcasing its features

## Tips for Success

* Explore available APIs early to understand their functionality
* Test OpenAI API usage (e.g., chat completion, image generation) and ensure you’re familiar with its capabilities
* Break your application into smaller tasks and test each component before integrating them
* Take advantage of AI in this project (brainstorming ideas, exploring questions, generating code, gaining insights ...)

This project is an opportunity to showcase your creativity and technical skills—have fun with it!
