# CVE API

## Parameters

### __cpeName__ (optional)

* ``{name}``

This parameter returns all CVE associated with a specific CPE. The exact value provided with ``cpeName`` is compared against the CPE Match Criteria within a CVE applicability statement. If the value of ``cpeName`` is considered to match, the CVE is included in the results.

A CPE Name is a string of characters comprised of 13 colon separated values that describe a product. In CPEv2.3 the first two values are always “cpe” and “2.3”. The 11 values that follow are referred to as the CPE components. When filtering by ``cpeName`` the part, vendor, product, and version components are __REQUIRED__ to contain values other than "*".

CPE Match Criteria comes in two forms: CPE Match Strings and CPE Match String Ranges. Both are abstract concepts that are then correlated to CPE URIs in the Official CPE Dictionary. Unlike a CPE Name, match strings and match string ranges do not require a value in the part, vendor, product, or version components. The CVE API returns CPE Match Criteria within the ``configurations`` object.

### __cveID__ (optional)

* {CVE-ID}

This parameter returns a specific vulnerability identified by its unique Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures identifier (the CVE ID). cveId will not accept {CVE-ID} for vulnerabilities not yet published in the NVD.

* ``disputed``
* ``unsupported-when-assigned``
* ``exclusively-hosted-service``

This parameter returns only the CVE records that include the provided ``cveTag``.

### __cvssV2Metrics__ (optional)

* ``{CVSSv2 vector string}``

This parameter returns only the CVEs that match the provided ``{CVSSv2 vector string}``. Either full or partial vector strings may be used. This parameter cannot be used in requests that include ``cvssV3Metrics`` or ``cvssv4Metrics``.

Please note, as of July 2022, the NVD no longer generates new information for CVSS v2. Existing CVSS v2 information will remain in the database but the NVD will no longer actively populate CVSS v2 for new CVEs. NVD analysts will continue to use the reference information provided with the CVE and any publicly available information at the time of analysis to associate Reference Tags, information related to CVSS v3.1, CWE, and CPE Applicability statements.

### __cvssV2Severity__ (optional)

* ``LOW``
* ``MEDIUM``
* ``HIGH``

This parameter returns only the CVEs that match the provided CVSSv2 qualitative severity rating. This parameter cannot be used in requests that include ``cvssV3Severity`` or ``cvssv4Severity``.

Please note, as of July 2022, the NVD no longer generates new information for CVSS v2. Existing CVSS v2 information will remain in the database but the NVD will no longer actively populate CVSS v2 for new CVEs. NVD analysts will continue to use the reference information provided with the CVE and any publicly available information at the time of analysis to associate Reference Tags, information related to CVSS v3.1, CWE, and CPE Applicability statements.

### __cvssV3Metrics__ (optional)

* ``{CVSSv3 vector string}``

This parameter returns only the CVEs that match the provided ``{CVSSv3 vector string}``. Either full or partial vector strings may be used. This parameter cannot be used in requests that include ``cvssV2Metrics`` or ``cvssv4Metrics``.

### __cvssV3Severity__ (optional)

* ``LOW``
* ``MEDIUM``
* ``HIGH``
* ``CRITICAL``

This parameter returns only the CVEs that match the provided CVSSv3 qualitative severity rating. This parameter cannot be used in requests that include ``cvssV2Severity`` or ``cvssv4Severity``.

Note: The NVD will not contain CVSS v3 vector strings with a severity of ``NONE``. This is why that severity is not an included option.

### __cvssV4Metrics__ (optional)

* ``{CVSSv4 vector string}``

This parameter returns only the CVEs that match the provided ``{CVSSv4 vector string}``. Either full or partial vector strings may be used. This parameter cannot be used in requests that include ``cvssV2Metrics`` or ``cvssv3Metrics``.

### __cvssV4Severity__ (optional)

* ``LOW``
* ``MEDIUM``
* ``HIGH``
* ``CRITICAL``

This parameter returns only the CVEs that match the provided CVSSv3 qualitative severity rating. This parameter cannot be used in requests that include ``cvssV2Severity`` or ``cvssv3Severity``.

Note: The NVD will not contain CVSS v3 vector strings with a severity of ``NONE``. This is why that severity is not an included option.

### __cweID__ (optional)

* ``{CWE-ID}``

This parameter returns only the CVE that include a weakness identified by Common Weakness Enumeration using the provided ``{CWE-ID}``.

Note: The NVD also makes use of two placeholder CWE-ID values ``NVD-CWE-Other`` and ``NVD-CWE-noinfo`` which can also be used.

### __hasCertAlerts__ (optional)

This parameter returns the CVE that contain a Vulnerability Note from CERT/CC. Please note, this parameter is provided without a parameter value.

### __hasCertNotes__ (optional)

This parameter returns the CVE that contain a Vulnerability Note from CERT/CC. Please note, this parameter is provided without a parameter value.

### __hasKev__ (optional)

This parameter returns the CVE that appear in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog. Please note, this parameter is provided without a parameter value.

https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog

### __hasOval__ (optional)

This parameter returns the CVE that contain information from MITRE's Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) before this transitioned to the Center for Internet Security (CIS). Please note, this parameter is provided without a parameter value.

https://oval.mitre.org/inuse/

### __isVulnerable__ (optional)

This parameter returns only CVE associated with a specific CPE, where the CPE is also considered vulnerable. The exact value provided with ``cpeName`` is compared against the CPE Match Criteria within a CVE applicability statement. If the value of ``cpeName`` is considered to match, and is also considered vulnerable the CVE is included in the results.

If filtering by ``isVulnerable``, ``cpeName`` is __REQUIRED__. Please note, ``virtualMatchString`` is not accepted in requests that use ``isVulnerable``.

### __keywordExactMatch__ (optional)

By default, ``keywordSearch`` returns any CVE where a word or phrase is found in the current description.

If the value of ``keywordSearch`` is a phrase, i.e., contains more than one term, including ``keywordExactMatch`` returns only the CVEs matching the phrase exactly. Otherwise, the results will contain records having any of the terms. If filtering by ``keywordExactMatch``, ``keywordSearch`` is __REQUIRED__. Please note, this parameter is provided without a parameter value.

### __keywordSearch__ (optional)

* ``{keyword(s)}``

This parameter returns only the CVEs where a word or phrase is found in the current description. Descriptions associated with CVE are maintained by the CVE Assignment Team through coordination with CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs). The NVD has no control over CVE descriptions.

Please note, empty spaces in the URL should be encoded in the request as "%20". The user agent may handle this encoding automatically. Multiple ``{keywords}`` function like an 'AND' statement. This returns results where all keywords exist somewhere in the current description, though not necessarily together. Keyword search operates as though a wildcard is placed after each keyword provided. For example, providing "circle" will return results such as "circles" but not "encircle".

### __lastModStartDate & lastModEndDate__ (optional)

* ``{start date}``
* ``{end date}``

These parameters return only the CVEs that were last modified during the specified period. If a CVE has been modified more recently than the specified period, it will not be included in the response. If filtering by the last modified date, both ``lastModStartDate`` and ``lastModEndDate`` are __REQUIRED__. The maximum allowable range when using any date range parameters is 120 consecutive days.

A CVE's ``lastModified`` changes when any of the follow actions occur:

The NVD publishes the new CVE record
The NVD changes the status of a published CVE record after it has been analyzed
A source (CVE Primary CNA or another CNA) modifies a published CVE record

A CVE's ``lastModified`` does not change when any of the follow actions occur:

The NVD changes the status of a newly published CVE record to "Undergoing Analysis"
The NVD modifies a CPE record previously associated with the CVE record
Values must be entered in the extended ISO-8601 date/time format:

``[YYYY][“-”][MM][“-”][DD][“T”][HH][“:”][MM][“:”][SS][Z]``

The "T" is a literal to separate the date from the time. The Z indicates an optional offset-from-UTC. Please note, if a positive Z value is used (such as +01:00 for Central European Time) then the "+" should be encoded in the request as "%2B". The user agent may handle this encoding automatically.

### __noRejected__ (optional)

By default, the CVE API includes CVE records with the REJECT or Rejected status. This parameter excludes CVE records with the REJECT or Rejected status from API response. Please note, this parameter is provided without a parameter value.

### __pubStartDate & pubEndDate__ (optional)

* ``{start date}``
* ``{end date}``

These parameters return only the CVEs that were added to the NVD (i.e., published) during the specified period. If filtering by the published date, both ``pubStartDate`` and ``pubEndDate`` are __REQUIRED__. The maximum allowable range when using any date range parameters is 120 consecutive days.

Values must be entered in the extended ISO-8601 date/time format:

``[YYYY][“-”][MM][“-”][DD][“T”][HH][“:”][MM][“:”][SS][Z]``

The "T" is a literal to separate the date from the time. The Z indicates an optional offset-from-UTC. Please note, if a positive Z value is used (such as +01:00 for Central European Time) then the "+" should be encoded in the request as "%2B". The user agent may handle this encoding automatically.

### __resultsPerPage__ (optional)

* ``{page limit}``

This parameter specifies the maximum number of CVE records to be returned in a single API response. For network considerations, the default value and maximum allowable limit is 2,000.

It is recommended that users of the CVE API use the default ``resultsPerPage`` value. This value has been optimized to allow the greatest number of results over the fewest number of requests.

### __startIndex__ (optional)

* ``{offset}``

This parameter specifies the index of the first CVE to be returned in the response data. The index is zero-based, meaning the first CVE is at index zero.

The CVE API returns four primary objects in the response body that are used for pagination: ``resultsPerPage``, ``startIndex``, ``totalResults``, and ``vulnerabilities``. totalResults indicates the total number of CVE records that match the request parameters. If the value of ``totalResults`` is greater than the value of ``resultsPerPage``, there are more records than could be returned by a single API response and additional requests must update the ``startIndex`` to get the remaining records.

The best, most efficient, practice for keeping up to date with the NVD is to use the date range parameters to request only the CVEs that have been modified since your last request.

### __sourceIdentifier__ (optional)

* ``{sourceIdentifier}``

This parameter returns CVE where the exact value of ``{sourceIdentifier}`` appears as a data source in the CVE record. The CVE API returns ``{sourceIdentifier}`` values within the ``descriptions`` object. The Source API returns detailed information on the organizations that provide the data contained in the NVD dataset, including every valid ``{sourceIdentifier}`` value.

### __versionEnd & versionEndType__ (optional)

* ``{ending version}``
* ``including``
* ``excluding``

The ``virtualMatchString`` parameter may be combined with ``versionEnd`` and ``versionEndType`` to return only the CVEs associated with CPEs in specific version ranges.

If filtering by the ending version, ``versionEnd``, ``versionEndType``, and ``virtualMatchString`` are __REQUIRED__. Requests that include ``versionEnd`` cannot include a version component in the ``virtualMatchString``.

### __versionStart & versionStartType__ (optional)

* ``{starting version}``
* ``including``
* ``excluding``

The ``virtualMatchString`` parameter may be combined with ``versionStart`` and ``versionStartType`` to return only the CVEs associated with CPEs in specific version ranges.

If filtering by the ending version, ``versionStart``, ``versionStartType``, and ``virtualMatchString`` are __REQUIRED__. Requests that include ``versionStart`` cannot include a version component in the ``virtualMatchString``.

### __virtualMatchString__ (optional)

* ``{cpe match string}``

This parameter filters CVE more broadly than ``cpeName``. The exact value of ``{cpe match string}`` is compared against the CPE Match Criteria present on CVE applicability statements.

CPE Match Criteria comes in two forms: CPE Match Strings and CPE Match String Ranges. Both are abstract concepts that are then correlated to CPE URIs in the Official CPE Dictionary. Unlike a CPE Name, match strings and match string ranges do not require a value in the part, vendor, product, or version components. The CVE API returns CPE Match Criteria within the ``configurations`` object.

CPE Match String Ranges are only supported for the version component and only when ``virtualMatchString`` is combined with ``versionStart``, ``versionStartType``, and/or ``versionEnd``, both ``versionEndType``.

``cpeName`` is a simpler alternative for many use cases. When both ``cpeName`` and ``virtualMatchString`` are provided, only the ``cpeName`` is used.

## Response

### CVE API JSON Schema

The API response may contain up to four JSON schema that define the structure of the response data. Each of the documents below describe a different aspect of the response but all include information on data types, regex patterns, maximum character length, and other information that can support developers and database administrators looking to create their own local repository.

CVE API Schema: https://csrc.nist.gov/schema/nvd/api/2.0/cve_api_json_2.0.schema \
CVSSv3.1 Schema: https://csrc.nist.gov/schema/nvd/api/2.0/external/cvss-v3.1.json \
CVSSv3.0 Schema: https://csrc.nist.gov/schema/nvd/api/2.0/external/cvss-v3.0.json \
CVSSv2.0 Schema: https://csrc.nist.gov/schema/nvd/api/2.0/external/cvss-v2.0.json

### Response Details

The CVE API returns seven primary objects in the body of the response: ``resultsPerPage``, ``startIndex``, ``totalResults``, ``format``, ``version``, ``timestamp``, and ``vulnerabilities``.


The ``totalResults`` object indicates the number of CVE that match the request criteria, including all parameters. If the value of ``totalResults`` is greater than the value of ``resultsPerPage``, then additional requests are necessary to return the remaining CVE. The parameter ``startIndex`` may be used in subsequent requests to identify the starting point for the next request. More information and the best practices for using ``resultsPerPage`` and ``startIndex`` are described above.

The ``format`` and ``version`` objects identify the format and version of the API response. ``timestamp`` identifies when the response was generated.

The ``vulnerabilities`` object contains an array of objects equal to the number of CVE returned in the response and is sorted in ascending order by the ``published`` property of the ``cve`` object. The ``cve`` object is explained in more detail below.

JSON response objects are either optional or required. Required response objects are always returned by the API and may contain fields without data. Optional response objects are only returned when they contain data. For example, the ``cvssMetricV3`` object is optional. CVSSv3.0 was released in 2016, thus most CVE published before 2016 do not include the ``cvssMetricV3`` object. The exception are CVE published before 2016 that were later reanalyzed or modified. These CVE may have been updated to include CVSSv3 information. If the CVE was updated in this way, the API response would include this optional information.

### cve __REQUIRED__

This object always contains the CVE-ID, sourceIdentifier an identifier for the source of the CVE, published the date and time that the CVE was published to the NVD, lastModified the date and time that the CVE was last modified, and vulnStatus the CVE's status in the NVD.

This object also contains seven __optional__ fields. The ``evaluatorComment``, ``evaluatorImpact``, and ``evaluatorSolution`` provide additional context to help understand the vulnerability or its analysis. If the CVE is listed in CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog ``cisaExploitAdd``, ``cisaActionDue``, ``cisaRequiredAction``, and ``cisaVulnerabilityName`` will be returned. The ``cisaActionDue`` object indicates the date by which all federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies are required to complete the ``cisaRequiredAction`` under Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01, Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities. Although not bound by BOD 22-01, every organization, including those in state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) governments and private industry can significantly strengthen their security and resilience posture by prioritizing the remediation of the vulnerabilities listed in the KEV catalog as well.

This object may also contain up to seven objects with additional nested information. The ``cveTags``, ``description``, ``metrics``, ``weaknesses``, ``configurations``, ``references``, and ``vendorComments`` objects are explained in more detail below.

### cveTags (optional)

This object contains one or more tags that provide contextual information about the CVE.

``source`` identifies the organization that provided the CVE Tag information and ``tags`` identifies each relevant CVE Tag.

#### JSON Example

"cveTags": [
>	{
>>		"sourceIdentifier": "cve@mitre.org",
>>		"tags": [
>>>			"disputed"

>>		]

>	}

],

### ``description``s __REQUIRED__

This object contains a description of the CVE in one or more languages. ISO 639-1:2002's two-letter language identifiers indicate the language of the description. Spanish language translations are provided by the Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE).

#### JSON Example

"descriptions": [
>	{
>>        "lang": "en",
>>		"value": "The debug command in Sendmail is enabled, allowing attackers to execute commands as root."

>    }, \
>	{

>>		"lang": "es",
>>		"value": "El comando de depuración de Sendmail está activado, permitiendo a atacantes ejecutar comandos como root."

>	}

],

### metrics (optional)

This object contains information on the CVE's impact. If the CVE has been analyzed, this object will contain any CVSSv2 or CVSSv3 information associated with the vulnerability.

``source`` identifies the organization that provided the metrics information and ``type`` identifies whether the organization is a primary or secondary source. Primary sources include the NVD and CNA who have reached the provider level in CVMAP. 10% of provider level submissions are audited by the NVD. If a submission has been audited the NVD will appear as the primary source and the provider level CNA will appear as the secondary source.

#### JSON Example

>>    ]

},


### weaknesses (optional)

This object contains information on specific weaknesses, considered the cause of the vulnerability. Please note, a CVE that is Awaiting Analysis, Undergoing Analysis, or Rejected may not include the weaknesses object.

``source`` identifies the organization that provided the weakness information and ``type`` identifies whether the organization is a primary or secondary source. Primary sources include the NVD and CNA who have reached the provider level in CVMAP. 10% of provider level submissions are audited by the NVD. If a submission has been audited the NVD will appear as the primary source and the provider level CNA will appear as the secondary source.

#### JSON Example

"weaknesses": [
>	{
>>		"source": "nvd@nist.gov",
>>		"type": "Primary",
>>		"description": [
>>>			{
>>>>				"lang": "en",
>>>>				"value": "NVD-CWE-Other"

>>>			}

>>		]

>	}

],

### configurations (optional)

This object contains the CVE applicability statements that convey which product, or products, are associated with the vulnerability according to the NVD analysis. Please note, a CVE that is Awaiting Analysis, Undergoing Analysis, or Rejected will not include the configurations object.

Like the JSON response, ``configurations`` are a hierarchical data structure that always contain one or more CPE match strings. Each object within ``configurations`` includes either an OR- or an AND-operator (and in rare cases a NEGATE flag) to covey the logical relationship of the CPE or child objects within. For example, if the vulnerability exists only when both CPE products are present, the operator is “AND”. If the vulnerability exists if either CPE is present, then the operator is “OR”.

The ``cpeMatch`` object contains the CPE Match Criteria, the criteria's unique identifier, and a statement of whether the criteria is vulnerable. The ``matchCriteriaId``'s corresponding ``{uuid}`` may be used with either the Match Criteria API's ``matchCriteriaId`` or the CPE API's ``matchCriteriaId`` parameters.

Match Criteria API's ``matchCriteriaId``: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/products#cpematch-matchCriteriaId \
 CPE API's ``matchCriteriaId``: https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/products#cpes-matchCriteriaId

#### JSON Example

"configurations": [
>	{
>>		"nodes": [
>>			{
>>>				"operator": "OR",
>>>				"negate": false,
>>>				"cpeMatch": [
>>>					{
>>>>						"vulnerable": true,
>>>>						"criteria": "cpe:2.3:a:eric_allman:sendmail:5.58:*:*:*:*:*:*:*",
>>>>						"matchCriteriaId": "1D07F493-9C8D-44A4-8652-F28B46CBA27C"

>>>					}
>>>				]

>>			}
>>		]

>    }

],

### references __REQUIRED__

This object contains supplemental information relevant to the vulnerability, and may include details that are not present in the CVE Description. Each reference within this object provides one or more resource tags (e.g., third-party advisory, vendor advisory, technical paper, press/media, VDB entries). Resource tags are designed to categorize the type of information each reference contains.

``source`` identifies the organization that provided the reference information and ``type`` identifies whether the organization is a primary or secondary source. Primary sources include the NVD and CNA who have reached the provider level in CVMAP. 10% of provider level submissions are audited by the NVD. If a submission has been audited, the NVD will appear as the primary source and the provider level CNA will appear as the secondary source.

#### JSON Example

"references": [
>	{
>>		"url": "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Jun/16",
>>		"source": "security@netgear.com"

>    },
>	{
>>		"url": "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/06/05/4",
>>		"source": "security@netgear.com"

>	},

>	},
>	{
>>		"url": "http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1",
>>		"source": "security@netgear.com"
>	}

]

### vendorComments (optional)

This object contains any Official Vendor Comment for the CVE. NVD provides a service whereby organizations can submit Official Vendor Comments for CVE associated with their products. Organizations can use the service in a variety of ways. For example, they can provide configuration and remediation guidance, clarify vulnerability applicability, provide deeper vulnerability analysis, dispute third party vulnerability information, and explain vulnerability impact. Official Vendor Comments can be submitted to the NVD by email at nvd@nist.gov. More information is provided on the vendor comments page.

#### JSON Example

"vendorComments": [
>	{
>>		"organization": "Red Hat",
>>		"comment": "Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of the util-linux packages (providing /bin/login), as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4 or 5.",
>>		"lastModified": "2008-12-18T00:00:00"

>	}
