    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The core dataset driving this application is user-defined. Each user supplies a customized whitelist of software products to ingest CPEs using Feature 1 of the tool. In other words, the application itself generates the dataset at runtime rather than relying on a fixed third-party file. This bakes in versatility as a core component.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Approach\n",
    "* __Tailored Relevance__: Users see only vulnerabilities that apply to their stack—no noise from unrelated products.\n",
    "* __Privacy__: Because the whitelist is entered directly into the app and never leaves the tenancy, no proprietary system details are exposed to third parties.\n",
    "* __Freshness on Demand__: The ETL job re-runs automatically whenever the whitelist changes, so the dataset is always in sync with the user’s current environment. <--- in an ideal world\n",
    "* __Pedagogical Fit__: Demonstrates the full “Extract → Transform → Load” pattern even though the extract phase starts with user data rather than a public file.\n",

    "* Modular ETL – the fetcher is a self-contained script, so swapping NVD for another feed (e.g., VulnDB) only touches one module.\n",
    "* Stateless Front-End – Streamlit pulls live parquet data at page-load; no additional server state is required.\n",
    "* Reproducibility – Every transformation is expressed in notebook cells and committed to version control; anyone can re-run from raw CSV/parquet.\n",
    "* Security – API keys are injected at runtime via environment variables; no secrets in code or repos.\n",
    "* Extensibility – To add a new scoring dimension (e.g., exploit-in-the-wild), drop a column into the metrics DataFrame and adjust the weight vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Flow\n",
    "* __Whitelist → ETL__ Scheduler launches the Python ingestion script once a day (or on-demand during demos).\n",
    "* __ETL → Storage__ Each run appends new/modified CVEs to smb_cves.parquet; duplicates are removed on write.\n",
    "* __Storage → Processing__ Pandas aggregates the parquet rows and mapping tables into a per-asset metrics DataFrame.\n",
    "* __Processing → OpenAI/UI__\n",
    "    * The risk-score table feeds both the bar/heat-map visualisations and the GPT prompts.\n",
    "    * GPT responses are streamed back into the dashboard for end-users.\n",
    "* __UI → Notebook/Slides__ Users can export the notebook to HTML or capture screenshots for executive slides."
