    "The core dataset driving this application is user-defined. Each user ingests CPEs using F1 (Asset Inventory Module) of the tool to generate personalized datasets.

    "#### Why This Approach\n",
    "* __Tailored Relevance__: Users see only vulnerabilities that apply to their stack—no noise from unrelated products.\n",
    "* __Privacy__: Because the whitelist is entered directly into the app and never leaves the tenancy, no proprietary system details are exposed to third parties.\n",
