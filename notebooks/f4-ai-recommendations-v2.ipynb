Although there was a drop of 52.8% in Q3 2022, the numbers remained high, with a peak of 36 high severity vulnerabilities in Q2 2022. The trend continued with fluctuations, showing a 550% increase in Q1 2023, and a 128.6% rise in Q2 2024. However, there was a notable decrease of 45.5% in Q4 2024.\n",
