   - **Medium Severity:** The medium-severity vulnerabilities also saw fluctuations, with a notable increase in 2022Q2 (24 vulnerabilities) and a subsequent decrease in 2022Q3 (11 vulnerabilities), followed by another increase in 2023Q3 (19 vulnerabilities).

2. **Oracle Database Server 19c:**
   - **Critical Severity:** The critical vulnerabilities remained relatively stable, with occasional spikes such as in 2019Q1 and 2020Q1, each reporting 1 critical vulnerability.
   - **Medium Severity:** There was a significant increase in medium-severity vulnerabilities in 2019Q4, with a 600% increase from the previous quarter. However, this was followed by a decrease in subsequent quarters.

3. **Microsoft Exchange Server 2019:**
   - **Critical Severity:** There were sporadic critical vulnerabilities, with notable occurrences in 2019Q1 and 2023Q3.
   - **Medium Severity:** The medium-severity vulnerabilities showed variability, with a peak in 2019Q2 (2 vulnerabilities) and a decrease in subsequent quarters.

4. **Oracle Database 19c (Enterprise):**
   - **Medium Severity:** There was a notable increase in medium-severity vulnerabilities in 2019Q3, with a 200% increase from the previous quarter. This trend continued with fluctuations over the subsequent periods.

5. **Alfresco:**
   - **Medium Severity:** There was a spike in medium-severity vulnerabilities in 2020Q1, with an increase from 0 to 3 vulnerabilities, indicating a potential emerging risk.

### Significant Spikes or Drops
