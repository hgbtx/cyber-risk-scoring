### Risk Trends Insights

Upon analyzing the vulnerability data across various assets and severities, several key trends and emerging risk patterns have been identified:

1. **Adobe Acrobat Reader**:
   - **High Severity Vulnerabilities**: Adobe Acrobat Reader has experienced significant fluctuations in high severity vulnerabilities. Notably, there was a 466.7% increase in high severity CVEs in Q1 2022, followed by another spike of 111.8% in Q2 2022. However, this was followed by a sharp decline of 52.8% in Q3 2022 and an 88.2% drop in Q4 2022. The trend continued with a 550% increase in Q1 2023, followed by a more moderate 15.4% rise in Q2 2023 and a 6.7% increase in Q3 2023. This volatility suggests a fluctuating risk profile that requires close monitoring.
   - **Medium Severity Vulnerabilities**: There was a notable 300% increase in medium severity vulnerabilities in Q2 2022, followed by a 54.2% decrease in Q3 2022. The trend continued with a 1800% spike in Q3 2023, indicating a significant rise in medium severity vulnerabilities that could pose a risk if not addressed promptly.

2. **Oracle Database Server 19c**:
   - **Critical and High Severity Vulnerabilities**: The Oracle Database Server 19c showed a consistent pattern of critical vulnerabilities appearing intermittently, with a notable presence in Q1 2019 and Q4 2019. High severity vulnerabilities were observed to have a 100% increase in Q1 2021, followed by a 66.7% decrease in Q2 2020, indicating a fluctuating risk landscape.
   - **Medium Severity Vulnerabilities**: A significant 600% increase in medium severity vulnerabilities was observed in Q4 2019, followed by a 57.1% decrease in Q1 2020. This pattern of spikes and drops suggests an unstable vulnerability profile that requires ongoing attention.

3. **Microsoft Exchange Server 2019**:
   - **Critical Severity Vulnerabilities**: Critical vulnerabilities were observed in Q1 2019 and Q3 2023, with a complete absence in other quarters, indicating sporadic but potentially severe risks.
   - **Medium Severity Vulnerabilities**: There was a 100% increase in medium severity vulnerabilities in Q2 2019, followed by a 50% decrease in Q3 2019, and a complete absence in Q1 2021. This inconsistency highlights the need for vigilance in monitoring these vulnerabilities.

4. **Emerging Concerns**:
   - **Fortinet Fortigate 7000**: A critical vulnerability emerged in Q2 2023, marking a new risk that needs immediate attention to prevent potential exploitation.
   - **Alteryx Server**: A medium severity vulnerability was recorded in Q3 2023, indicating a new area of concern that should be monitored for further developments.

### Assets and Severities Requiring Immediate Attention

Based on the recent trends, the following assets and severities require immediate attention:

- **Adobe Acrobat Reader**: The frequent and significant fluctuations in high and medium severity vulnerabilities necessitate continuous monitoring and timely patching to mitigate potential risks.
- **Oracle Database Server 19c**: The sporadic appearance of critical vulnerabilities and the significant spikes in medium severity vulnerabilities suggest a need for enhanced security measures and regular vulnerability assessments.
- **Fortinet Fortigate 7000**: The emergence of a critical vulnerability in Q2 2023 highlights the need for immediate security reviews and patch management to address potential threats.

In conclusion, while some assets show sporadic vulnerabilities, others like Adobe Acrobat Reader and Oracle Database Server 19c exhibit more volatile patterns, indicating a need for focused security efforts to manage and mitigate emerging risks effectively.
