Analyzing the provided data, several key trends and patterns emerge across different assets and severities over the quarters.

### Significant Spikes and Drops:

1. **Adobe Acrobat Reader:**
   - **High Severity:** There was a notable increase in high-severity vulnerabilities from 17 in 2022Q1 to 36 in 2022Q2, marking a 111.8% increase. This trend continued with fluctuations, reaching 16 in 2024Q2, then dropping to 6 in 2025Q1.
   - **Medium Severity:** The vulnerabilities saw a significant increase from 6 in 2022Q1 to 24 in 2022Q2 (300% increase), followed by fluctuations, with a notable spike to 19 in 2023Q3 before dropping to 3 in 2025Q1.

2. **Oracle Database Server (19c):**
   - **High Severity:** There was a spike in high-severity vulnerabilities in 2020Q1 with 3 vulnerabilities, followed by a sharp decline to 1 in 2020Q2 and remaining low thereafter.
   - **Medium Severity:** A significant increase occurred in 2019Q4 with 7 vulnerabilities, a 600% increase from the previous quarter, but then declined to 1 by 2021Q4.

3. **Microsoft Exchange Server (2019):**
   - **Critical Severity:** There were critical vulnerabilities reported in 2019Q1 and 2023Q3, with a notable absence in other quarters.
   - **Medium Severity:** Fluctuations were observed, with a peak of 2 vulnerabilities in 2019Q2, followed by a decline to 0 in 2021Q1.

4. **Adobe Acrobat Reader (2022Q1 to 2025Q1):**
   - The high-severity vulnerabilities peaked at 36 in 2022Q2 and fluctuated thereafter, indicating a persistent risk that requires monitoring.

### Emerging Risk Patterns:

- **Adobe Acrobat Reader** consistently shows high numbers of vulnerabilities, especially in high and medium severities, indicating a persistent risk that needs immediate attention. The fluctuations in vulnerability counts suggest ongoing security challenges.
  
- **Oracle Database Server (19c)** experienced significant spikes in medium-severity vulnerabilities, particularly in 2019Q4, which suggests a need for focused security measures during that period. The high-severity vulnerabilities also saw a notable spike in 2020Q1.

- **Microsoft Exchange Server (2019)** showed sporadic critical vulnerabilities, which could indicate targeted attacks or newly discovered vulnerabilities that require immediate patching.

### Assets and Severities Requiring Immediate Attention:

1. **Adobe Acrobat Reader**: Given the consistent high numbers of high and medium-severity vulnerabilities, this asset requires immediate attention to mitigate potential risks.

2. **Oracle Database Server (19c)**: The spikes in medium-severity vulnerabilities, particularly in 2019Q4, suggest a need for enhanced monitoring and patch management strategies.

3. **Microsoft Exchange Server (2019)**: The presence of critical vulnerabilities in certain quarters highlights the need for timely updates and security patches to prevent exploitation.

In conclusion, while Adobe Acrobat Reader presents the most consistent risk across quarters, Oracle Database Server and Microsoft Exchange Server also show periods of heightened vulnerability that require proactive management to ensure security posture is maintained.
